# Backstage Tech Challenge

## Background
* The Director of Finance has requested “a report on correlations between the weather and our sales”. We can assume the hypothesis is that weather has an effect on sales. He
* did not provide many details, but let’s assume he does not currently have easy access to this data and therefore needs an analysis of the current state, as well as access to * this data as a report going forward.  Our final output will be 1) a summary of key findings after exploratory analysis of the data and 2) a link to a report with             * instructions on how to access, refresh, etc. 

### PROPOSED PLAN 

## Objective
* 1) Examine the correlation between weather and uw basket weaving sales
* 2) Provide report for finance to access and explore this data going forward

## Areas for exploratory analysis / cuts of data to be included in a report: 
* 1) Location → Variation of weather impact by continent/country/state, etc
* 2) Seasonality →  Does correlation of weather to sales change with the seasons?
*    - Mapping required to assign ‘seasons’ to countries 
*    - Month over month view will show if Christmas/holiday season sales has weather correlation
* 3) Additional sales metrics → Weather’s impact on: 
*    - Avg order value, Avg daily orders, Avg daily $ per customer, Avg daily units per customer
* 4) Customer Segmentation → Variation of weather impact on different types of customers:
*	 - New vs. repeat buyers, High/medium/low lifetime value segments, Customer cohort analysis
